1: (if you did t1) 
1.1: Did you see the problem when testing before implementing the do_copy() method? Did the problem go away afterwards?

1.2: Why do you have to $cast rhs to rhs_ in the reference implementation?


2: (if you did t2) 
2.1: Did you see your new sequence in a) The topology print? b) The factory configuration print? Why / why not?

2.2: What benefits and downsides do you find in the factory override way of doing things?


3: (if you did t3) Do you think your test coverage actually improved after doing this? 


4: (if you did t4) 
4.1: Did you see the rst_n go low during the test in the first part? Why / why not?

4.2: The FIFO is not really a good DUT for demonstrating the power of constraints. Give an example of a real-life testcase where constraints would really be useful.


5: (if you did t5) What kind of time limit and coverage goal did you decide?


6: (if you did t6) What did you decide to print in the logs?


7: How much time you used to finish this exercise?
