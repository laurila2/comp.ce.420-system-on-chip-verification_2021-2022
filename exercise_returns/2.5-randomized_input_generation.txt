1: What is the advantage of using constrained random sequences instead of directed testing?
   Reduced manual effort and bigger coverage, and more likely to hit corner cases.

2: Which signals you decided to randomize? Did you use constraints for randomization?
   We randomised the input signals in transaction; data_to_DUT, write_enable and read_enable.
   We used constraints for randomization.

3: What is the reason for creating a new test for the constrained random testing instead of modifying the test_base?
   Then we can run parallel tests. In this way we have one randomized test and one directed test.
   
4: Why is it better to tell the test name in the simulator command line instead of top level?
   That way we can choose the test in the beginning of the run.
