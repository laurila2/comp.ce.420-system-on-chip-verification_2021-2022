1: Do you have previous experience of hardware description languages? Which of these design languages/paradigms have you used before?
<VHDL | Verilog/SystemVerilog | SystemC | High-level Synthesis | others?>

Santeri: Experience in VHDL, SystemC
Alper: VHDL, Verilog

2: What is the advantage of using a testbench rather than a ".do" file?

With testbenches you can have more flexibility with functionality than with .do-files.

3: Why do we call these testbenches simple testbenches? What crucial testbench functionality is missing?

Usually tb is in a diffrent file. Here we also didnt have any checks. We just eyeballed the results from the testbench.

4: What is the difference between initial and always procedures in SystemVerilog?

Initial processes execute once, procedures repeatedly execute forever.
